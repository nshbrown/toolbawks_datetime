= Datetime Toolbocks

Datetime Toolbocks is a very simple Ruby on Rails Engine which provides a helper method to 
instantly deploy the Datetime Toolbocks into your application.

The Datetime Toolbocks also includes JSCalendar as a subset of functionality. It is in the long 
term goal to enable this plugin to be able to be used as a whole, or by accessing each part. 
Whether that is the JSCalendar with a default text input box, advanced Datetime Toolbocks 
input without JSCalendar, or with both combined which is currently the default.

This software package is developed using the Engines plugin. To find out more about how to 
use engines in general, go to http://svn.rails-engines.org for general documentation about 
the Engines mechanism.
